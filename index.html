            <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cooking the pasta:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the chicken:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
                        <li>In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat.</li>
                        <li>Add the chicken breasts to the skillet and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center. The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken. Once done, remove the chicken from the skillet, let it rest for a few minutes, then slice it into thin strips.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil and sauté the bell peppers over medium heat for about 3-4 minutes, or until they begin to soften.</li>
                <li>Add the minced garlic to the skillet with the bell peppers and sauté for another minute, or until the garlic is fragrant.</li>
                <li>Pour in the white wine (if using) and chicken broth to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
                <li>Add the capers and cooked chicken slices to the skillet and let everything simmer for about 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
                <li>Stir in the chopped basil leaves and let them wilt slightly in the pan for a minute or two.</li>
                <li>Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.</li>
                <li>To serve, place a portion of cooked pasta on each plate and top with the chicken, bell pepper, caper, and basil mixture. Drizzle some of the flavorful pan sauce over each serving.</li>
                <li>Optionally, garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and additional fresh basil leaves.</li>
            </ol>
